# AGENTS.md

<!-- BEGIN SHARED GUIDELINES: copied from pkgforge-apps/.github by scripts/sync-guidelines.sh. Edit them there. -->

Guidelines for anyone, human or agent, working on a pkgforge-apps
repository. Every app in the organization starts from the
[app template](https://github.com/pkgforge-apps/app-template) and follows
these rules, so the repositories stay consistent with each other.

These guidelines, the shared skills, the shared scripts and the CI and
release workflows live in
[pkgforge-apps/.github](https://github.com/pkgforge-apps/.github). Each
app carries a copy that `scripts/sync-guidelines.sh` refreshes. When
they change there, pkgforge-apps-bot opens a pull request in every app
with the update. Edit them there,
never in an app; an edit made in an app is overwritten by the next sync.
`.agents/shared-guidelines.lock` lists every shared file.

## Purpose

pkgforge-apps builds lightweight native desktop apps: original ones,
and alternatives to heavyweight apps, Electron apps in particular. Each
app is a single Rust binary. Small binary, fast start, low memory: if a
change works against those, it needs a strong reason.

### Choosing the GUI library

- [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui), through eframe, is the default
  and what the app template is built on. It is immediate mode and
  mature: a good fit for tools, utilities, viewers and dashboards.
- [smudge](https://github.com/QaidVoid/smudge) is designed for
  general-purpose apps: a retained widget tree, fine-grained reactive
  signals, and repainting only what changed, which keeps an idle app
  idle. Prefer it for conventional desktop apps with many views, forms
  or documents. It is still in development: its API changes without
  notice and it is not on crates.io yet, so check its state and agree on
  it with the maintainer before starting an app on it.

Pick one per app at the start; do not mix them.

## Platforms

- Every app runs on Linux, macOS and Windows unless its function is tied
  to one OS. Say so in the README when it is.
- Put OS-specific code behind `#[cfg(target_os = "...")]` in its own
  module, with a fallback or a clear "unsupported" path on the others.
- Never hard-code path separators, line endings or config locations.
  Use `std::path`, and the platform conventions for config, data and
  cache directories.
- CI tests on all three platforms. A change that only compiles on yours
  is not done.
- An app that links a system library names its Debian packages, one per
  line, in `.github/apt-packages.txt`, and the jobs that build on Ubuntu
  install them first. The jobs that build in an Arch container read the
  same list in `.github/pacman-packages.txt`, with Arch's package names.
  Both files take comments. Keep them to what the build needs: the
  release bundles carry their own libraries, so this is for compiling,
  not for running.

## Workflow

- Commit one logical change at a time. Never commit a broken state.
- Run `scripts/check.sh` before every commit. It runs what CI runs.
- Never bump the version or edit `CHANGELOG.md` by hand. release-plz
  owns both.

### Commit messages

Semantic, imperative, one line, at most 68 characters:

```
type: imperative message
type(scope): imperative message
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `style`,
`chore`, `ci`, `revert`. Use `feat!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for
breaking changes. Keep any body short. The commit types decide the next
version and the changelog groups, so pick them carefully:

- `feat: add a recent files menu`
- `fix(editor): keep the cursor on undo`
- `perf: cache decoded thumbnails`

## Code

- Write idiomatic Rust, edition 2024, on the latest stable toolchain.
- Document every item: modules (`//!`), functions, structs, enums,
  variants, fields and constants (`///`). Doc comments say what a thing
  is for and any contract a caller must keep. CI enforces this through
  `missing_docs` and `clippy::missing_docs_in_private_items`.
- No narrative comments. Do not restate what the code does. An inline
  comment is for a non-obvious *why*: a platform quirk, a workaround, a
  constraint that is not visible from the code.
- ASCII only, in every file: source, docs, configs, scripts. Write
  glyphs in Rust strings as `\u{..}` escapes. `scripts/check-ascii.sh`
  enforces it.
- Do not over-engineer. No abstraction, trait, generic or config knob
  for a case that does not exist yet. Three similar lines beat a
  premature helper.
- Prefer `Result` with context over panics. `expect` is for invariants
  that cannot fail, with a message that states the invariant.
- Scripts are POSIX `sh` (`#!/bin/sh`), never bash. They must pass
  `shellcheck -s sh`.

### egui apps

- Keep state and logic apart from drawing. Logic lives in plain types
  with plain methods that tests can call; `ui` functions read that
  state and turn input into calls on it.
- Never block the UI thread. Run I/O and heavy work on a
  `std::thread`, send results back over a channel, and call
  `ctx.request_repaint()` when they arrive. Reach for an async runtime
  only when the work is genuinely async-heavy.
- Repaint on demand. Do not request continuous repaints unless
  something is animating.
- The renderer is glow (OpenGL). Keep eframe's default features off and
  enable only what the app uses.
- Keep the `--smoke` flag working. CI and the release pipeline launch
  every build with it to prove the app opens a window and draws.

### smudge apps

- The template is built on egui. A smudge app starts from it and
  replaces `src/` and the eframe dependency; everything else stays,
  including the `--smoke` flag, which must draw a frame and exit 0.
- Until smudge is on crates.io, depend on it by git, pinned to a commit
  with `rev`. Move the pin deliberately, one change at a time, and read
  smudge's commits since the last pin first, since its API breaks
  without notice. Switch to crates.io once it is published.
- Follow smudge's own patterns: state in signals, views derived from
  them, and no work on the UI thread that could block a frame.
- Test views with smudge's headless harness, which runs the same frame
  pipeline a window does.

## Dependencies

- Add and change dependencies with `cargo add` and `cargo remove`,
  never by editing `Cargo.toml` by hand. Use `--no-default-features`
  and list only the features the app uses.
- Vet a crate before adding it. The `add-dependency` skill has the
  procedure. In short:
  - The latest release or commit must be under a year old.
  - An older crate is acceptable only when it is clearly complete,
    with no unanswered bug reports or stale PRs piling up.
  - Check what it pulls in with `cargo tree`. A large tree for a small
    feature is a reason to say no.
- Prefer inlining over a dependency when the functionality is a few
  dozen lines. A small, tested function in the app beats a crate.
- Prefer pure-Rust crates. A crate that links a C library adds a system
  dependency on every platform.
- No git dependencies and no `[patch]` sections. Releases build from
  crates.io. The one exception is smudge, until it is published.

## Tests

- Test behavior: what a user or caller can observe. A test should fail
  when the behavior breaks and pass through any refactor that keeps it.
- Test logic in unit tests next to the code. Test UI interaction when
  the behavior lives in the UI (clicking, typing, focus, layout that
  matters): with `egui_kittest` in an egui app, with smudge's headless
  harness in a smudge app.
- Every bug fix comes with a test that fails without the fix.
- Do not write tests that only restate the code: asserting a constant,
  that a constructor sets fields, or that a mock was called.
- Tests run on all three platforms. Use temporary directories, never
  fixed paths, and never depend on test order or wall-clock timing.

## Releases

Releases are fully automated by
[release-plz](https://release-plz.dev) on `GITHUB_TOKEN` only. No
personal tokens and no registry secrets; the `release` skill explains
the pipeline. In short:

1. Every push to `main` refreshes a release PR owned by
   github-actions[bot], with the next version and changelog.
2. Merging it tags the version and creates the GitHub release as a
   draft.
3. That starts `release.yml`, which builds and attaches the assets, then
   publishes the release. The organization makes published releases
   immutable, so assets go on while it is still a draft:

| Platform | Asset |
|----------|-------|
| Linux, portable | `<app>-<arch>-linux.onelf` |
| Linux, AppImage, opt-in | `<app>-anylinux-<arch>.AppImage` and its `.zsync` |
| Linux | `<app>-<arch>-linux.tar.xz` |
| macOS | `<app>-<arch>-macos.dmg` with an `.app` bundle |
| Windows | `<app>-x86_64-windows.exe` |

Only the plain Linux build is an archive, since it carries a desktop
entry and icons. The macOS disk image opens to the app and an
Applications link, the Windows executable runs as is with the C runtime
linked in, and the `.onelf` and `.AppImage` are single files. No
checksum files are published; every asset carries a build provenance
attestation instead.

The onelf bundle uses the stipplefs payload. An egui app's bundle
carries Mesa, so it draws on hosts without a usable GL stack, musl
distributions included; NVIDIA's driver still comes from the host. It
is the Mesa [onelf-pkgs/mesa](https://github.com/onelf-pkgs/mesa) builds
without LLVM, which adds about 8 MB; do not drop it to save space. A smudge
app drawing with its CPU renderer needs no GL, so it turns `gl` and
`dri` off in `onelf.toml`; confirm with the `test-linux-bundle` skill.

The onelf bundle updates itself with `--onelf-update`, downloading only
what changed since the copy it replaces. Once the app has its update key
it accepts only releases signed with it; the `release` skill covers how
the key is made and used.

Run the `test-linux-bundle` skill before merging any change that can
alter what the bundle loads: `onelf.toml`, a dependency that links or
opens a system library, an onelf upgrade, or a feature that reaches a
new part of the system such as audio, file dialogs or notifications.
The `onelf` skill covers inspecting and debugging a bundle.

An app may also ship an Anylinux AppImage, for users and managers that
expect that format, by setting `appimage = true` under
`[package.metadata.pkgforge]` in `Cargo.toml`. It is a second format,
not a replacement for the onelf bundle. The release pipeline builds it
with `scripts/package-appimage.sh`; the `anylinux-appimage` skill
covers it. An app whose stack quick-sharun cannot detect, such as the
audio servers reached through ALSA plugins, names the `DEPLOY_*`
variables it needs in `packaging/appimage/deploy.env`.

Apps are not published to crates.io by default. When one should be,
publish it through crates.io trusted publishing, never with a token
stored in repository secrets.

## Docs

- The docs site lives in `docs/`, built with VitePress and bun, and
  deploys to GitHub Pages from `main`.
- The site is personalized for the app: its own palette, type and
  home page. Do not ship the stock VitePress look. The `app-docs` skill
  covers it.
- Update the docs in the same change as the behavior they describe.

## Icons

`assets/icon.svg` is the single source for every icon, or
`assets/icon.png` when the icon is pixel art. Regenerate the rasters, the
Windows `.ico` and the docs favicons with `scripts/icons.sh` after
changing it. The `app-icon` skill covers the design rules.

```

## Skills

Procedures live in `.agents/skills/`. Claude Code only looks in
`.claude/skills/`, so each skill also has a symlink there, which
`scripts/sync-guidelines.sh` creates. These are shared by every app:

- `add-dependency` vets and adds a crate, or decides to inline it.
- `anylinux-appimage` packages the app as an Anylinux AppImage.
- `app-icon` designs the icon and regenerates every raster.
- `app-docs` personalizes the docs site.
- `release` explains and troubleshoots the release pipeline, including
  crates.io trusted publishing.
- `onelf` inspects and debugs the portable Linux bundle.
- `test-linux-bundle` smoke-runs a bundle on the hosts users have.
- `sync-guidelines` refreshes the shared guidelines and skills.

The template also carries `bootstrap-app`, which turns a fresh copy into
a new app and is removed once that is done. An app may add skills of its
own; give them names the shared ones do not use, since a sync replaces a
shared skill of the same name.

<!-- END SHARED GUIDELINES -->

## This app

Blue Dove is a music player for a directory of audio files. It scans the
directory, reads tags with `lofty`, decodes with `rodio`, and draws with
egui. It has no database: the directory is the library, rescanned at each
start.

Modules, in `src/`:

| Module | Holds |
|--------|-------|
| `app.rs` | application state and the logic behind it |
| `ui.rs` | every drawing function and the input it turns into calls |
| `library.rs` | scanning, tag reading, album grouping |
| `cover.rs` | album art decoding, scaling and the PNG a media widget loads |
| `art.rs` | the pictures a window has decoded, off the drawing thread |
| `cache.rs` | the on-disk cache of the scanned library |
| `mpris.rs` | the MPRIS service, which lets playerctl and media keys drive it |
| `instance.rs` | the one-window lock and the socket a second launch asks through |
| `decode.rs` | opening an audio file with the decoder its format needs |
| `game/` | the decoders for video game rip formats |
| `opus.rs` | the Ogg Opus reader, which symphonia lacks |
| `player.rs` | the rodio device, player and seek calls |
| `downmix.rs` | the fold from a surround track to stereo |
| `waveform.rs` | the peak envelope of a track, computed off the UI thread |
| `dialog.rs` | the directory chooser, through rfd with zenity as the fallback |
| `config.rs` | the settings file, playlists included |
| `theme.rs` | the palette and type scale |
| `fonts.rs` | the CJK fallback font, loaded from the system when present |
| `format.rs` | duration and count formatting |
| `error.rs` | the `At` trait, which puts a path on a decoder's error |
| `cli.rs` | the command line: flags, paths and the music directory they imply |
| `abx.rs` | the blind comparison: ten trials, scored against guessing |
| `digest.rs` | the SHA-256 of a file, for the sums the comparison shows |

Platform notes:

- Audio goes through cpal's ALSA backend, so the build links
  `libasound`: `alsa-lib` on Arch, `libasound2-dev` on Debian and
  Ubuntu. This is the only system dependency.
- The ALSA plugins that reach PulseAudio and PipeWire are loaded by
  name from a directory compiled into libasound. The AppImage gets them
  from quick-sharun's audio deployment; `onelf.toml` lists them in
  `include` with `/usr/lib/alsa-lib` on `search-paths`, since the
  library scan cannot see them.
- Every decoder is pure Rust: symphonia through rodio for the common
  formats, and `decode.rs` for the ones symphonia lacks (Monkey's Audio,
  WavPack, TTA, Musepack, Shorten, AMR). Those decode a file whole into
  memory. DSD is not supported, and neither are TAK and WMA: the only
  Rust TAK decoder is GPL-3.0, and this app is MIT.
- AMR comes from `rvoip-codec-core`, which is bit-exact against the 3GPP
  reference. Its lib is named `codec_core`, not after the package, so the
  import is `codec_core::..`. Only the `amr` feature is on, so the G.729,
  Opus and G.711 codecs are not compiled in. The storage format's magic
  number picks narrowband (8 kHz) from wideband (16 kHz); a comfort-noise,
  no-data or lost frame carries no mode of its own, so it is decoded in the
  mode the last speech frame used.
- `opus.rs` streams instead of decoding up front: it hands rodio one
  packet at a time, so `open` costs a read of the file's tail for the
  length, not a decode of the file. Decoding whole took 789 ms on a
  3-minute track and 1.4 s on a 6-minute one, all of it before the first
  sample played, which is why Opus tracks lagged the others. Its seek
  uses the Ogg reader's page bisection and then drops the samples it
  decoded ahead of the target, which lands exactly; a seek costs about
  5 ms. `discard` counts interleaved samples, not frames, so it has to be
  scaled by the channel count.
- Game rips have their own decoders in `game/`: Sony VAG, CRI ADX and
  Nintendo DSP, BRSTM, BCSTM and BFSTM. They are small headers over an
  ADPCM stream, so they are written by hand rather than pulled from a
  crate. A rip carries no tags, so `library.rs` lists it under its file
  name, and its length stays unknown until it plays.
- A surround track is folded to stereo by `downmix.rs` before the mixer
  sees it. rodio's own conversion keeps the first two channels and
  throws the rest away, which drops the centre a 5.1 mix puts the voice
  in and the surrounds it puts much of the drums in, so a surround track
  sounded nothing like the stereo one. The fold is the ITU-R BS.775
  matrix, in the channel order WAV and FLAC use without a layout: the
  centre and each surround at -3 dB, the LFE dropped, and no overall
  attenuation, which is what keeps the track at the level of a stereo
  one. The wrapper forwards `try_seek`, so the seek bar works on it.
  `Audio::play_file` is the only place a track reaches the device, so
  the blind comparison is folded the same way.
- Album art comes from `cover.rs`, which decodes JPEG with `zune-jpeg`,
  PNG with `png` and SVG with `resvg`, then scales the result. Nothing
  decodes a picture while a library is listed: a scan stores the encoded
  bytes and keeps only the key, and `art.rs` decodes them on a thread of
  its own, so a library of thousands of tracks opens without decoding a
  single image. One queue feeds that thread, in the order keys were asked
  for: `adopt_library` hands over `Library::covers()` when a library lands,
  so a cover is decoded whether or not its row is ever painted, and the
  drawing pass asks for what it shows as it scrolls. Only a picture the
  drawing pass asked for makes the window repaint, so the work behind it
  costs no frames. A key that was decoded once stays decoded (up to
  `KEPT`, past which the one decoded longest ago goes), so scrolling back
  over it costs nothing. eframe pulls `image` in on its own, so the crate
  is still in the tree; the app does not use it.
- A file's own art wins. Failing that, `library.rs` looks beside the
  tracks: the conventional names first, then an image named after
  `cover`, `front`, `folder` or `album`, then the only image there. A
  `covers`, `artwork` or `scans` directory is searched too, and a disc
  directory takes the art from the directory above it, where a multi-disc rip
  keeps one cover for the set.
- The directory chooser goes through `rfd`, which asks the XDG file-chooser
  portal and falls back to `zenity`. Neither is required to build; both
  are optional at runtime, and the window says what to install when
  neither answers. zenity is deployed into the AppImage.
- The scan leaves out files and directories whose name starts with a dot
  unless **View > Ignore hidden files** is turned off; it is on by default.
  `read_library_with` filters the walk with `filter_entry`, and the root is
  never filtered by its own name, since a music directory may sit under a
  dotted one. The setting lives in `Config::ignore_hidden` and changing it
  starts a scan again.
- The scan result is cached under the user's cache directory:
  `library-<hash>.toml` holds the tags, one file per music directory so
  two of them keep a cache each, `covers/` holds each picture as the
  image file it was found in, named by a hash of its bytes, `art/` holds
  those same covers as the PNGs MPRIS names to a media widget, and
  `waveforms/` holds the peak envelopes the seek bar draws. Decoding art
  is what made a scan slow (about 6.4 s of 6.5 s on eight thousand
  tracks), so no scan and no cache read decodes a picture: they only
  record the key of one. A scan of a large directory therefore takes
  well under a second. `src/art.rs` holds the thread that does decode,
  an `Art` per window, with two kinds of work: `request` names a picture
  the window is about to draw and is decoded next, and `prefetch` hands
  over the whole library at once, which is worked through behind the
  frames. The thread looks for drawn work before it touches the bulk, so
  the cover on screen never waits for the queue; a key it has decoded is
  skipped if the bulk names it later. `adopt_library` prefetches
  `Library::covers()`, and the drawing pass asks for what it scrolls to,
  so a cover is ready whether or not its row is ever painted. Only a
  picture the frame asked for makes the window repaint, and `pending` is
  true only while such a picture is outstanding, so the work behind it
  costs no frames. At most `KEPT` decoded pictures are held; the one
  decoded longest ago is dropped and may be decoded again later; the key is
  dropped from the thread's memory of what it decoded too (`Art::forget`),
  or the ask for it again would be swallowed and the window would wait for a
  picture nobody sends. `retain`, `forget_missing` and the eviction all go
  through it. `decode_now` is the blocking path MPRIS art uses. A library that lands
  keeps the pictures and textures `Library::covers()` still names, which
  a rescan over the same album usually does, and forgets the keys that
  answered with no picture, so one stored since is asked for again.
  Entries store a track's path relative to the music directory, so a
  directory named another way still finds them: a symlink and its target,
  or `/tmp` and `/private/tmp` on macOS, are one place under two names.
  `covers/` and `art/` are shared by every music directory's cache, so
  `prune_covers` keeps a key any `library-<hash>.toml` in the directory
  still names at the current `cache::VERSION`, not only the one being
  written. A cache is named after the resolved path, so a symlinked music
  directory and its target keep one entry, and `Cache::load_from` keeps the
  root in the spelling the current run uses so the tracks it builds are
  named the way that run walks them.
  `Cache::load_from` answers `None` when the directory is gone, since an
  unmounted drive would otherwise open as a library. `read_cache` takes
  the cache at its word rather than checking every file against the disk,
  which would cost one `stat` per track; the scan behind the window is
  what reads a changed file again and rewrites the cache. An entry is
  used by a scan while the file's size and modification time match and
  the picture it names is still in `covers/`, which is checked once per
  key rather than once per track: that is what makes deleting the cache
  directory safe, since the scan then reads the files that named the
  missing pictures and stores them again. Bump `cache::VERSION` when the
  stored shape changes, or an older file will be misread. Under
  `cfg(test)` the cache directory is `target/test-cache/<pid>`, so a test
  scan never writes beside the real library, and `save` there does not prune
  because the tests share that directory: a prune would delete pictures
  another test stored. A temporary file is named with the process, the thread
  and a counter, so two writers of one file lose each other's bytes only if
  they share all three: `covers/` and `art/` are shared by every instance, and
  two windows on one library write there at the same time.
- Settings live in `config.toml` under the user's config directory.
  Playlists are stored there by file path, not by library index, because
  the library is rescanned at every start. They are written as they
  change and again on exit, so a killed window loses nothing; a smoke
  run writes nothing at all.
- Ten themes: the app's own palette, Adwaita and Breeze in both variants,
  Nord, Catppuccin Mocha and Latte, and Solarized Dark and Light. A stored
  theme is what the window shows; only a first run with none stored asks
  the desktop, through `Theme::first_run`. KDE gets Breeze Dark, since its
  programs look wrong in an amber palette beside a Breeze window, and every
  other desktop keeps the app's own dark theme. `Theme::first_run` reads
  `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, and `Theme::for_desktop` is the pure part the test
  drives.
- `mpris.rs` serves MPRIS on the session bus, so playerctl and the media
  keys work. The bus is optional: the service is connected on its own
  thread, and a host without a bus, or with another player holding the
  name, leaves the app running with only the remote control missing. A
  command wakes the window through a waker, since the app repaints on
  demand and would otherwise not notice until the mouse moved.
- The art a desktop's media widget shows is named by `mpris:artUrl`, a
  `file://` URI, so the playing track's cover is written out as a PNG
  under `art/` in the cache, named after the key its picture is stored
  under. The pixels come from the window's decoded pictures when it has
  them, and are decoded on the spot for a track that plays without being
  drawn.
  `cache::art_file` writes it once per cover, `cover::to_png` encodes it,
  and `App::art` keeps the file for as long as that track plays: a frame
  that encoded it again would cost more than drawing the window. Starting
  a track drops it and so does a stop, so it never names the art of a
  track that is not the one playing, and a file `prune_covers` removed is
  written again. A cover that could not be written is remembered as such
  rather than retried on every frame, which a cache directory refusing
  the file would otherwise cost. `prune_covers` drops the art of a cover
  the library no longer uses, along with the cover itself.
- `Raise`, which is what clicking the player in a media widget sends,
  goes through `App::raise_window` rather than the bare focus a transport
  command gets: a window that a close left hidden or minimized has to be
  brought back, not merely focused.
- Random Order is one shuffle of the playlist, held in `App::shuffle`, not
  a fresh draw at every step: every track is heard once before any comes
  back, and Previous then Next plays the same track again. The order is
  drawn the first time it is needed and dropped by `forget_shuffle` when
  the playlist or queue changes, so it always fits what is being walked.
- With "Keep Playing When Closed" on, closing the window hides it and the
  music plays on; the audio is on its own thread, so nothing stops. The
  rule lives in `keeps_playing_on_close`, which also says Quit and a
  close with nothing loaded still end the app. A hidden window gets no
  drawing pass, so everything the player does between frames runs in
  eframe's `logic` hook: `App::logic` polls the workers, the remote
  control and launches, and calls `advance`, which hands over to the next
  track when one ends. A track that ran out would otherwise sit there.
- Wayland has no request that hides a window: the compositor owns
  visibility, and winit's Wayland backend ignores `set_visible`, reports
  both the visibility and the minimized state as unknown, and drops an
  unminimize. A close there therefore asks `xdg_toplevel.set_minimized`
  instead, which takes the window off the screen with the music still
  playing, and `raise_window` asks for critical attention through
  xdg-activation, the one request mutter honours, when a launch or a
  media widget wants the window back. `on_wayland` reads the two
  variables winit picks its backend by, since the app forces neither.
- `cli.rs` parses the arguments before a window exists, so a bad one is
  reported on the terminal. `--help` and `--version` answer and exit;
  `--play`, `--pause`, `--play-pause`, `--stop`, `--next` and `--previous`
  become an `Action` and travel to the running window as a
  `cli::Action::command()`, which is the same `mpris::Command` the bus
  uses, so the two cannot drift. Paths travel too: `App::open_paths` puts
  a file in the tab named Default (creating it when there is none) and
  replaces what it held, and appends a directory's tracks to the showing
  playlist. A path that arrives before the scan has finished waits in
  `App::pending_paths` and is applied when the scan lands.
- A launch naming exactly one audio file opens the **preview**: the art, the
  line naming the track, and a strip with only repeat, stop and play, with
  the waveform below and no menu bar. `App::preview_candidate` decides what
  qualifies (one path, a file, an extension the decoder takes); the setting
  in **View > Preview a single file**, on by default, decides whether it
  applies. The file is read by `library::read_one`, not looked up in the
  library, because a file manager names files that need not be under the
  music directory; the track lives in `App::preview` and in no playlist, so
  a preview never replaces what the Default tab holds. Right clicking the
  art leaves the preview for the window, which puts the track in the Default
  tab; a file the library does not hold cannot go there, since a save stores
  paths the next scan has to find again. `advance` handles the preview before
  the playlist walk, so a track that runs out repeats or stops rather than
  stepping to a track that is not there. `open_pending_paths` takes the
  preview path before it looks at the scan: the file is read on its own, so
  waiting for a library that need not contain it would leave the full window
  on screen while eight thousand files were read.
- The preview is a **fixed-size** window: `App::pin_window` sets its minimum
  and its maximum to the same size and sends `Resizable(false)`, so a drag on
  a border and a window manager honouring size hints both refuse. The size is
  `COMPACT_SIZE` when the file carries art and the shorter
  `PREVIEW_NO_ART_SIZE` when it does not; the answer is kept in
  `App::preview_art`, read from the file when the preview opens, so the
  layout inside a window that cannot shrink cannot change either.
  `exit_preview` lifts the pin before the full layout lands: the regular and
  compact layouts stay resizable, and a window left pinned would stay fixed
  for the rest of the run. A track with no cover draws no square at all: an
  empty box the size of a cover would be the largest thing in the window and
  say nothing. The menu a right click on the art gives, which is also the way
  out of the preview, is offered on the name line when there is no art.
- `main.rs`'s `window_viewport` sets a maximum size for the preview alone, and
  the full window asks for none rather than for an infinite one: Wayland
  carries the max size as a `u32` on the client side and as an `i32` in the
  protocol, so infinity arrives as -1, a size xdg-shell refuses, and a
  compositor enforcing that, mutter among them, closes the window instead of
  opening it.
- A file opened through `instance::Request::Open`, which is what a file
  manager sends when the player is already running, previews exactly like a
  fresh launch: the two paths meet in `App::take_request`. Anything else
  arriving that way is a session, so `open_paths` calls `exit_preview` first
  and the window gets its floor and its size back before the content lands.
- Files dropped on the window from a file manager go through the same
  `App::open_paths` a command line path does, so a drop and a launch of the
  same path behave alike. The drop is read from `raw.dropped_files` in
  `logic`, which runs even while the window is hidden.
- `instance.rs` makes a launch find the window that is already running
  instead of opening a second one. It takes an exclusive `try_lock` on a
  file in the runtime directory (the cache directory stands in where that
  is missing) and listens on a loopback socket whose port it writes
  beside the lock; a second launch reads the port, sends its
  `instance::Request` (show, an action, or paths to open), and exits 0.
  A request is text: a verb on the first line, then one path per line, so
  a path holding a line break is refused when the arguments are parsed. The kernel drops the lock when the process ends, so
  a crashed window does not leave the app taken. No D-Bus is involved,
  which is what makes it work on a host without a session bus.
- Previous restarts the playing track while it has played for more than
  `RESTART_AFTER` (three seconds, the usual few), and moves to the track
  before it only when the press comes earlier or after such a restart.
  `back_restarts` holds that rule, so it is testable without a device. The
  MPRIS Previous command goes through the same `step`.
- The track table has a multi-row selection in `View::selection`, with
  `View::selected` as the anchor a shift-click measures from. Playing a
  selection does not rewrite the playlist: it becomes `App::queue`, which
  Next, Previous and Random walk until a row is played by hand. Removing
  rows edits `playlist.tracks` and nothing else: the app never deletes,
  moves or rewrites an audio file, and a test pins that.
- A blind comparison, **Blind Comparison** in the playlist's right-click
  menu, takes exactly two selected rows, the first as A and the second as
  B, and lives in `App::abx` and `abx.rs`. It is kept out of the playlists
  and the table on purpose: the table highlights the playing row, and a
  highlight would say which of the two X is. For the same reason `advance`
  leaves the player alone while a test is open, and playing a row or
  opening the preview ends the test. `App::abx_seed` mixes the clock into
  `random_state` so a restart does not repeat the sides the run before it
  drew. Nine right answers of ten pass, the smallest count under the
  usual 5% level: guessing reaches nine or more 1.1% of the time, eight
  5.5%. The window opens in the middle of the screen and is dragged from
  its title bar, and everything in it that is not a paragraph is centred:
  the trial and its question with `ui::centered_label`, and the rows of
  buttons with `ui::centring_shift`, which works the shift out from the
  width each button takes. The one
  button that is not centred is Close, which sits at the left edge: the
  middle is where the buttons pressed over and over are, and a Close under
  the pointer there is one press away from ending a test by accident. The
  window is a fixed size in every state, since the answer row changes from
  two buttons to one and a window following its content would jump under
  the pointer on every guess; `ui::layout_tests` draws each state and
  fails when the content outgrows it.
  Each track is named with the SHA-256 of its file, eight characters of
  it and the whole sum on hover: two encodes of one song carry the same
  tags, so the sums are what tells them apart. Under the names is a plain
  seek bar, drawn by `ui::abx_seek_bar` rather than the waveform, and a
  `Start at` field that sets `App::abx_start`: every choice is played from
  that moment, so the two are compared where the listener cares about
  rather than at the intro, and it outlives one test for the same reason.
  `digest.rs` reads both on
  a thread and the window asks for a repaint every 50 ms until they
  arrive, since a listener who has yet to press a button would otherwise
  leave the frame that shows them unasked for. Whether an answer was right
  is said only in the result: a verdict after every trial would tell the
  listener what X is on the next one, and `abx.rs` keeps no per-trial
  verdict to draw from.
  A finished test is signed. `Abx::log` writes the two file names with
  their sums, every trial with the score as it stood, and the total with
  its p-value; `Abx::signature` is the SHA-256 of exactly that text, and
  `Abx::signed_log` puts that text above the `-- signature --` line, so
  `awk '/^-- signature --$/{exit} {print}' | sha256sum` over a copied log
  gives the line under the marker. The marker is written with no blank line
  before it, so the top of the text is the signed text byte for byte. The sums are the first lines of what is signed, which ties
  a signature to two files rather than to two titles. `Copy Log` puts the
  text on the clipboard, since a signature that cannot be taken out of the
  window cannot be checked.
- The search box is `View::searching` and `View::filter`, drawn above the
  table by `ui::search_bar`. `Ctrl+F` or `/` opens it and `View::search_focus`
  asks for the keyboard once, so the box does not take it back every frame.
  `App::refilter` selects the first match as the text changes, and
  `App::step_match` walks them on Enter, wrapping at the end. `Down` in the
  box surrenders the keyboard and steps into the table, which is how the
  results are walked with the arrows. Opening an album, switching tabs or
  adding a directory calls `close_search`, since a filter left over from
  the old playlist would hide the new one. `visible_tracks` is the one
  place the filter is applied, so the table, the selection walk, select-all
  and the range selection all agree on what is shown.
- A shortcut is matched by `chord`, which reads the modifiers off the key
  event and consumes the press. `input.modifiers` is the state when the
  frame runs, and a quick press has released control by then, so a chord
  read from it arrives as a bare letter and is missed; the plain arrows
  never worked as volume keys for the same reason. The arrows walk the
  table, `Shift` jumps to its ends and `Ctrl` changes the volume.
- Double-clicking a directory appends what it holds to the playlist:
  `Directory::tracks_deep` walks it in the order the album list draws it,
  so each album's tracks in playing order, then the loose files beside
  them, then each subdirectory. A directory of loose files alone queues
  those, since it holds no album.
- The **Add All** button in the Library header appends every track in the
  library to the playlist, in the order the album list draws them:
  `Library::tracks_deep` walks the tree, loose files included. Leaving
  them out emptied the playlist for the case that matters most, a music
  directory holding nothing but files.
- `Library::root` is the music directory itself, and `directories()` is
  its children. A file sitting directly in the music directory has an
  empty relative path, and it used to be dropped from the tree along with
  every album in that directory: the album list, Add All and a
  double-click all missed it. Those albums and loose files now head the
  list at depth 0, with no row naming the music directory above them,
  since the directories beside them are what that row would indent.
  `place` builds each directory's path from the root down, so a nested
  directory carries `Box/Disc 1` rather than `Disc 1` and two releases
  with a disc directory of the same name stay apart.
- Both long lists draw only the rows on screen. The track table does it
  from `ui::table_rows`, and the album list from `ui::LibraryRow`, a
  flattened tree built once a frame (indices and paths, no borrows) with
  `library_row_tops` giving each row its place. The album list used to lay
  out and paint every album on every frame, which made a frame cost more
  the larger the library was: 520 albums came to 0.85 ms of CPU per frame
  and now cost 0.32 ms, nearly flat as the library grows. Rows carry
  paths rather than a borrow of the tree, so `App::add_directory_at` and
  `App::toggle_collapsed_at` take the path a click gives.
- The peak envelope itself is kept in the cache directory under
  `waveforms/`, one file per track named by a hash of its path, size and
  modification time, so a retag or a re-encode gets a fresh entry. Peaks
  are stored a byte each: the bar is drawn a point at a time, so a 256th
  of the loudest peak is finer than a pixel, and an envelope is about
  1.6 KB. `waveform::spawn` reads a stored envelope and sends it before
  it returns, so a track played before draws its bar in the frame it
  starts; decoding it took 51 ms on a short track, which is what left the
  bar empty at the start of every play. `MAX_WAVEFORMS` bounds the
  directory, oldest dropped first. No database: the files sit beside the
  covers the same way.
- The waveform's bar heights are cached in `App::wave_columns`, keyed on
  the width, the bar's height and the number of peaks. Rebuilding a few
  hundred of them is cheap but not free, and the drawing pass runs at
  50 fps while a track plays.
- While a track plays the window repaints every 20 ms, so the seek bar's
  cursor moves smoothly; a short track moves it across the bar quickly,
  and a slower rate showed as jumps. The MPRIS position poll stays at
  250 ms, which is all a client reading the position needs.
- Below `COMPACT_BREAK` the window drops the album list and the playlist
  and shows only the menu bar, the art, the controls and a thin waveform.
  It snaps once, when it crosses into that layout, so the window manager
  is not fought while the user drags; growing it back past the break
  restores the full layout. The snap is `COMPACT_SIZE` when the track has
  art and the shorter `COMPACT_NO_ART_SIZE` when it does not, so a missing
  square leaves no empty height behind. The popup stays resizable but the
  size it picked is also its floor, so it can be made larger and not
  smaller: below that the controls and the waveform are squeezed out of a
  window with no room for them. The ceiling is lifted with it, so growing
  back past the break still returns the full layout, and the floor drops to
  `COMPACT_MIN_SIZE` again on the way out, which is what lets the window be
  dragged back down into the popup. The art keeps
  its full width in the popup, and
  the window is made tall enough for the line naming the track
  (`compact_name`: the name, or the file name, then its position, both in
  the accent) between the art and the controls; shrinking the art to fit
  the line would defeat the point of the popup.
- The track table's columns are `ui::Column`, in drawing order: number,
  title, file name, artist, album and length. `column_layout` in `ui.rs`
  takes the six stored widths and `App::columns_shown`, and scales the
  shown ones together to the panel; each stops at its own minimum
  (`Column::min_width`, narrower for the number), and only past that does
  the table keep its width and scroll sideways. A hidden column gets no
  width and takes no part in the scaling, so the others take its room.
  `column_starts` is shared by the header and the rows, so a label cannot
  drift away from the values under it. A drag moves width between the two
  columns a border separates, which keeps their total fixed and the border
  under the pointer at any scale.
- The table is laid out as `ui::TableRow`s, not one row per track:
  `table_rows` heads each run of an album's tracks with `TableRow::Album`,
  which draws the cover, the album name with its year, its artist and a
  rule to the right edge. A run that starts again after another album is
  headed again, and a loose file heads nothing. The headings are taller
  than the rows (`ALBUM_ROW_HEIGHT`), so `row_tops` gives each row its
  place and the drawing and the reveal scroll both read from it rather
  than multiplying a row index by one height. `Library::album_indices`
  is what says which album a track belongs to, built once per frame.
- The column titles sit in a strip above the scroll area rather than in
  it, so they stay in reach while a long playlist scrolls; the strip
  follows the rows sideways by the scroll offset. A right click on it
  opens the column menu, where every column can be turned off and the
  widths can be put back. The title column holds the tags' titles and the
  file name column holds the files' own names; they are separate columns
  so a directory with bad tags can be read by name without losing the title.
- The playing row is drawn entirely in the accent, every column of it, and
  carries its position after the track's name. `name_column` decides which
  column that is: the title, or the file name when the title is off. The
  position used to hang off the title alone, so a table showing file names
  instead lost it.
- The album art sits at the top of the left-hand column, and the control
  strip below it carries the repeat button, the transport, the random
  button and the volume slider, in that order. The volume takes whatever
  width the buttons leave. The waveform below spans the whole width.
- The art's square is filled one of two ways, chosen by a right click on
  it and kept in `Config::cover_fit`: cropped (`square_crop`, the default,
  which fills the square and loses the edges of art that is not square) or
  fitted whole (`fit_rect`, which keeps every pixel and leaves the space
  beside it as background).
- Titles in a script egui's own faces do not draw need a system font:
  `fonts.rs` searches the system and user font directories for a font
  whose name says it carries them, one per script, preferring a full CJK
  face to a Japanese one and an Arabic face to the catch-all `DejaVu`, and
  carries none itself, to keep the binary small. A list of fixed paths was
  not enough: stock Arch and Debian install `DroidSansFallback`, which
  those paths did not name, so every Japanese title drew as boxes.
- Only the glyphs come from that font: egui has no bidirectional layout
  and no shaping, so a title in the Arabic script draws its letters one
  by one, left to right, in the order the tags hold them. The font turns
  the boxes into letters and no more; joining and reordering them is
  work egui has left undone.
- The directories are `XDG_DATA_HOME/fonts` and `XDG_DATA_DIRS/fonts`,
  with the spec's `/usr/local/share:/usr/share` standing in when the
  latter is unset or empty, plus the macOS and Windows locations. Reading
  the environment rather than a fixed path is what makes the AppImage
  work: quick-sharun rewrites the `/usr/share` literal in the binary to
  point inside the image, and the image's share directory carries no
  fonts, so a compiled-in path leads nowhere. The environment still names
  the host's directories at run time, so the fonts the user has are the
  ones that get used. Confirmed with strace on the shipped image: the
  compiled-in path opened `/tmp/<random>/fonts` and found nothing, and
  this one opens `/usr/share/fonts/droid/DroidSansFallbackFull.ttf`.
- Fontconfig is not consulted. It would mean parsing its configuration or
  linking a C library, and the XDG variables say the same thing in two
  lines; egui does its own font handling, so a font database would be a
  whole dependency for one path lookup.
- eframe's `accesskit` feature is off. Its atspi and zbus bindings cost
  around 1.5 MB, which the size budget for this app does not allow, so
  the window has no screen-reader support.
- The release binary is kept under 14 MB. Weigh it after a change that
  adds a dependency or a decoder; `strip`, fat LTO, `panic = "abort"`
  and one codegen unit are already on, and `opt-level` stays at the
  default rather than `"s"`.

The AppImage is built by the shared release job, which `Cargo.toml` opts
into with `appimage = true` under `[package.metadata.pkgforge]`. It
builds and smoke-runs the image before `publish` attaches it, in the same
step that publishes the release. `packaging/appimage/deploy.env` sets
`DEPLOY_PULSE`, so quick-sharun deploys the plugin cpal reaches through
libasound, and `.github/pacman-packages.txt` names the PulseAudio packages
it has to find on the build host. The result is
`blue-dove-anylinux-<arch>.AppImage` and its `.zsync`, named for what the
file is: an image that runs on any distribution, not one built for a
particular one.

The image carries its own glibc, `ld-linux` and libraries, so it depends
on neither the host's libc nor an FHS layout. Verified by running the
shipped image's `--version` in an `alpine` container, which has only the
musl loader, and in a `nixos/nix` one, which has no `/etc/os-release` and
no glibc loader; both printed the version and exited 0. Keep the wording
in `README.md` and `docs/guide/installation.md` to what the image does,
not to what the build host is.

PipeWire is not deployed. cpal reaches the sound server through an ALSA
plugin, and the image's default PCM is the pulse one, because
`99-pulseaudio-default.conf` sorts after `99-pipewire-default.conf`. That
plugin serves a PulseAudio host and a PipeWire host running
pipewire-pulse, which is the usual desktop setup. Deploying pipewire
too would add its client library and SPA plugins, about 2.9 MB, that no
config selects.

An app's own `appimage.yml` is not an option: it runs beside the release
workflow, and the organization makes published releases immutable, so an
image that finishes after `publish` cannot be attached to anything. That
is why the deploy variable and the packages are app-side files the shared
job reads rather than inputs to a separate workflow.

`.github/apt-packages.txt` names the Debian packages the build needs and
`.github/pacman-packages.txt` the Arch ones, which the jobs building in an
Arch container read. Both are what keep `alsa-sys` from failing: on the
Ubuntu runners, and in the onelf and AppImage containers.

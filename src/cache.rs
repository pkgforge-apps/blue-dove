//! A cache of the scanned library, so a start does not rescan every file.
//!
//! Reading the tags of a large directory is quick, but decoding its album art is
//! not: on a library of seven thousand tracks the pictures take most of the
//! six seconds a scan needs. This keeps what a scan found - the tags and the
//! encoded cover files - in the user's cache directory, so a start reads it
//! back in a fraction of that, and no scan or cache read decodes a picture.
//!
//! An entry is only good while its file is unchanged, which the stamp of the
//! file's size and modification time decides. A file that was retagged is
//! read again by the scan that runs behind the window, and a directory that
//! gained or lost files is scanned as usual.
//!
//! The peak envelope the waveform seek bar draws is kept here too, one small
//! file per track. Working it out means decoding the whole track, which is
//! what left the bar empty for a moment at the start of every play; from the
//! cache it is drawn at once.

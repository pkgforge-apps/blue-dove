//! Album art decoded off the drawing thread.
//!
//! A scan stores a cover's encoded bytes and keeps only the key it was stored
//! under, so listing a library of thousands of tracks decodes no picture. One
//! thread decodes them here instead, taking two orders of work: a picture the
//! window is about to draw, which is decoded next, and a bulk list of the rest,
//! which is worked through behind the frames. The thread looks for drawn work
//! before it touches the bulk, so a key the window asks for never waits behind
//! a whole library.
//!
//! `Art::prefetch` queues the whole library when one lands, so a cover is
//! decoded whether or not its row is ever on screen, and only a picture the
//! window asked for makes it repaint. A key is decoded once and its answer is
//! remembered, so a picture is decoded to be drawn or behind the frames but
//! never twice.
